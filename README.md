## Climbing the leaderboard

<https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/climbing-the-leaderboard/problem>

An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, so its leaderboard works like this:

- The player with the highest score is ranked number 1 on the leaderboard.
- Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive
  the immediately following ranking number.

Example

ranked = [100, 90, 90, 80]
player = [70, 80, 105]

result = [4,3,1]
