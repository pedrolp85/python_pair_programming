## Climbing the leaderboard

<https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/climbing-the-leaderboard/problem>

An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, so its leaderboard works like this:

- The player with the highest score is ranked number 1 on the leaderboard.
- Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive
  the immediately following ranking number.

Example

ranked = [100, 90, 90, 80]
player = [70, 80, 105]

result = [4,3,1]

## Multiples of 3 or 5

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/514b92a657cdc65150000006>

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
